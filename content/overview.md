# NostalgiaRB Overview

## What is NostalgiaRB?

NostalgiaRB is a lightweight site engine, written in Ruby with Sinatra, that treats your whole website like a folder.

- **Portable** → your entire site is just files; zip it, copy it, push it to GitHub.  
- **Rack-powered** → runs as a standard Rack app with Sinatra, deployable anywhere Ruby apps run.  
- **Simple backups** → copy the directory, done. Version control with GitHub is usually enough.  
- **Rapid prototyping** → spin up an idea, deploy, and test in minutes.  
- **Design freedom** → edit ERB templates, CSS, and partials without a framework fighting you.  
- **Future-proof** → if you move to Rails, Next.js, or anything else later, you already have your Markdown, styles, and assets.  

It’s for developers who want to **ship real content websites fast** with Ruby, but without committing to Rails or a heavyweight CMS.
